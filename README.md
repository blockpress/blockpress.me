# BlockPress
[BlockPress](https://blockpress.me) was a javascript/jquery content management system that uses various blockchains for backend storage, loaded via ajax modules. The project began life at the Lisbon Steemfest Hackathon on Nov 1, 2017. It was last actively developed in 2018. It is still an innovative front end only content management system that pulls data from APIs. It is useful for hosting more complex websites on hosts that only support HTML/CSS/JS and no backend language, such as Github Pages.
